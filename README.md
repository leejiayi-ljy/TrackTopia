# TrackTopia
Tracktopia seamlessly integrates with the Spotify Web API to provide personalized music recommendations based on your listening history. By interacting with the Spotify Web API, the app gains access to user's favorite tracks and favourite artists across a range of time frames. The app then derives the features of the track such as acousticness, danceability, instrumentalness, liveness, valence and more. Using these measures, it retrieves recommendations tuned to these measures to offer tailored music recommendations for the users based on the track. The Spotify Web API empowers Tracktopia to search for tracks, retrieve track features statistics, and recommend similar tracks to enhance your music discovery experience.
